## **Over the Peak — The 300km Epic Expedition from Garmisch to Lake Garda**

### **Conquer the Heart of the Alps**

This is more than just a ride; it is a profound dialogue between endurance and nature. Our journey begins in **Garmisch-Partenkirchen**, the gateway to the Alps south of Munich. Under the shadow of the Zugspitze, we will head south to face the ultimate bucket-list climb: the legendary **Timmelsjoch (Passo del Rombo)**.

### **Route Highlights**

- **The High Alpine Crossing:** Conquer the Timmelsjoch at an elevation of 2,474m. This "secret passage" connects the rugged Austrian Tyrol with the warmth of Italian South Tyrol. Prepare for dramatic hairpins and breathtaking glacial vistas.
- **Dramatic Scenery Shift:** As you cross the border through the mountain tunnel, watch the landscape transform from jagged alpine peaks to the sun-drenched vineyards and orchards of the Passiria Valley.
- **The Dream Finish:** Cycling through the historic streets of Merano and Trento, you will feel the air turn Mediterranean as you approach the shores of **Lake Garda**. There is no finish line more rewarding than the deep blue waters of Italy’s most iconic lake.

### **Essential Details**

- **Total Distance:** Approx. 300 km
- **Elevation Gain:** 4,000 m+
- **Difficulty:** Epic (Requires exceptional endurance and climbing experience)
- **Key Landmarks:** Timmelsjoch High Alpine Road, Adige Valley, Lake Garda.

Join us for this 300km odyssey. Experience the thrill of crossing Germany, Austria, and Italy in a single day—moving from glaciers to palm trees in one legendary push!
