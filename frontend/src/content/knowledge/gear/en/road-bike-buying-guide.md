Buying a road bike is an art. This guide covers budget, purpose, and brand considerations.

## Budget Tiers

| Tier | Price Range | Recommended Brands | Features |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Entry | €500-1500 | Giant, Trek, Decathlon | Aluminum frame, Shimano Sora/Tiagra |
| Mid-range | €1500-4000 | Canyon, Specialized, BMC | Carbon frame, Shimano 105/Ultegra |
| Professional | €4000+ | Cervélo, Pinarello, Colnago | Top carbon fiber, Ultegra Di2/SRAM Red |

## How to Choose

### 1. Define Your Purpose

- **Commuting/Leisure**: Durability first, entry-level is fine
- **Long-distance/Gran Fondo**: Comfort matters, mid-range recommended
- **Racing/Competition**: Lightweight and stiffness, professional level essential

### 2. Frame Size

The right frame size is the foundation of comfortable riding. We recommend getting a professional fitting at a bike shop.

### 3. Upgrade Path

Entry-level bike owners can consider upgrading:

1. Wheelset - Most noticeable improvement
2. Saddle - Improved comfort
3. Bar tape - Reduced hand numbness

## Where to Buy

- **Brand websites**: Canyon, Rose (direct-to-consumer brands offer great value)
- **Local bike shops**: Test rides available, reliable after-sales service
- **Second-hand market**: eBay Kleinanzeigen, BikeExchange (proceed with caution)
