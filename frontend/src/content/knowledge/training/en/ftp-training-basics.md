FTP (Functional Threshold Power) is the key metric for measuring cycling performance and the foundation of scientific training.

## What is FTP?

FTP represents the maximum average power output (watts) you can sustain for **1 hour**. It's the baseline for defining training zones.

### FTP Training Zones

| Zone | %FTP | Feeling | Training Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Z1 Recovery | <55% | Very easy | Active recovery |
| Z2 Endurance | 56-75% | Conversational | Aerobic base |
| Z3 Tempo | 76-90% | Somewhat challenging | Endurance building |
| Z4 Threshold | 91-105% | Difficult | FTP improvement |
| Z5 VO2max | 106-120% | Very painful | Maximum oxygen uptake |
| Z6 Anaerobic | 121-150% | All-out sprint | Anaerobic capacity |

## How to Test FTP

### Method 1: 20-Minute Test

1. Warm up for 10-15 minutes
2. Ride all-out for 20 minutes
3. Record average power
4. **FTP = Average Power × 0.95**

### Method 2: Ramp Test

Gradually increase power until exhaustion, ideal for platforms like Zwift.

## How to Improve FTP

### 1. Sweet Spot Training

Long rides at 88-94% FTP:

- 2×20 minutes, 5-minute rest
- 3×15 minutes, 3-minute rest

### 2. Threshold Intervals

Intervals at 95-105% FTP:

- 4×10 minutes, 5-minute rest
- 5×8 minutes, 4-minute rest

### 3. Adequate Recovery

Recovery is as important as training! Ensure 1-2 days of complete rest or easy riding per week.

## Recommended Tools

- **Power Meters**: Favero Assioma, Garmin Rally
- **Smart Trainers**: Wahoo KICKR, Tacx Neo
