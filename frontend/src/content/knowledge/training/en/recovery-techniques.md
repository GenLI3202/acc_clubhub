Training benefits are realized during recovery. Learning to recover scientifically is crucial.

## Recovery Essentials

1. **Nutrition Window**: Consume protein and carbs within 30 minutes post-ride
2. **Adequate Sleep**: 7-9 hours per night
3. **Active Recovery**: Easy riding or stretching
4. **Foam Rolling**: Relieve muscle tension
