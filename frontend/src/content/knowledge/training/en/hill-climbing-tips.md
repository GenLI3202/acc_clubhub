Climbing is a core challenge in road cycling. Mastering proper technique makes it much easier.

## Climbing Techniques

- **Steady Pacing**: Don't sprint at the start
- **Breathing Rhythm**: Deep breaths, stay consistent
- **Seated vs Standing**: Alternate to distribute fatigue
- **Choose Right Gearing**: Maintain 80-90rpm cadence
